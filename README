OSDP is an OCaml frontend library to semi-definite programming (SDP)
solvers.

See INSTALL for installation instruction.

See directory example for how to use the library.

Type
% make doc
to generate documentation (then see doc/index.html).

To use with the ocaml toplevel
% ledit ocaml
# #use "topfind";;
# #require "osdp";;
These last two lines can be added to ~/.ocamlinit to avoid typing them
again and again.

When running with OSX, some issues with the link of moseklib:
- either run the final binary with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:`dirname \`which mosek\``" thebinary
- or use install_name_tool to provide the absolute path in the dynamic linking lib
