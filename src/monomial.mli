(** Monomials of multiple variables (e.g., x^2 y z^3). *)

type t

(** [of_list l] produces the monomial corresponding to list [l]. For
    instance, considering the variables x0, x1, x2 and x3,
    [of_list\[3; 4; 0; 1\]] gives the monomial x0^3 x x1^4 x x3. *)
val of_list : int list -> t

(** The last element of the returned list is non zero (or the list is
    empty). *)
val to_list : t -> int list

val compare : t -> t -> int

val nb_vars : t -> int

val degree : t -> int

(** [mult m1 m2] multiplies the two monomials [m1] and [m2]. If one of
    them is defined on less variables, the undefined exponents are
    considered as 0 (for instance [mult (of_list \[1; 2\]) (of_list
    \[3; 4; 5\])] returns [m] such that [to_list m = \[4; 6; 5\]]). *)
val mult : t -> t -> t

(** [derive m i] returns [i, x_0^{j_0} ... x_i^{j_i - 1}
    ... x_n^{j_n})] if the degree [j_i] of variable [i] is positive in
    the monomial [m] and [0, of_list []] otherwise. [i] must be non
    negative. *)
val derive : t -> int -> int * t

(** [list_eq n d] provides the list of all monomials with [n]
    variables of degree equal [d] (for instance, [list_eq 3 2] can
    return [\[x0^2; x0 x1; x0 x2; x1^2; x1 x2; x2^2\]]). [n] must be
    positive and [d] must be non negative. *)
val list_eq : int -> int -> t list

(** [list_le n d] provides the list of all monomials with [n]
    variables of degree less or equal [d] (for instance, [list_le 3 2]
    can return [\[1; x0; x1; x2; x0^2; x0 x1; x0 x2; x1^2; x1 x2;
    x2^2\]]). [n] and [d] must be non negative. *)
val list_le : int -> int -> t list

(** [filter_newton_polytope s p] returns the list of the s_i in [s]
    such that 2s_i is in the convew hull of the p_1,..., p_n in
    [p]. C.f., Johan LÃ¶fberg, Pre- and Post-Processing Sum-of-Squares

    2009. *)

(** Pretty printing. Variables will be printed as x0, x1,... *)
val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit

(** Pretty printing. If [names] is to short, variables will be printed
    as x0, x1,... Providing a too short [names] list is not advisable
    however, as the generated names may collide with the provided
    ones. *)
