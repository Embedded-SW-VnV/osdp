Requirements
============

Compilation of the OSDP libraries requires:

* OCaml (>= 4.01)
* ocamlfind
* Zarith (Debian package libzarith-ocaml-dev, Opam package zarith),
* ocplib-simplex (>= 0.2, Opam package ocplib-simplex)

and optionally:

* Camlp4 (Debian package camlp4)
* CSDP (no Debian package, see below)
* MOSEK (no Debian package)
* SDPA{,-GMP,-DD}

Please note however that the OSDP library is mostly an interface to
SDP solvers and is quite useless if none of them (CSDP, MOSEK or SDPA)
is installed.

CSDP
----

To install Csdp:
* install dependencies:
  * liblapack-dev
  * libopenblas-dev
  * libatlas-base-dev
  * libatlas-dev
  * libblas-dev
  * gfortran
* download and untar it:
  % wget http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Csdp/Csdp-6.1.1.tgz
  % tar xvzf Csdp-6.1.1.tgz
* apply our patch (modified install target and enable the control printlevel)
  % cd Csdp-6.1.1
  % patch -p1 < path_to_osdp/external/csdp.patch
* you can change the variable PREFIX in Makefile
* type:
  % make
  % make install  # or sudo make install

MOSEK
-----

If you use MOSEK: Don't forget to set both PATH *and* LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to the directory containing the mosek binaries and libraries.

SDPA-GMP
--------

If you use SDPA-GMP: you may have to apply the patch
external/sdpa_gmp.patch before compiling SDPA-GMP.

SDPA-DD
-------

If you use SDPA-DD: install the QD library from
http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist before compiling SDPA-DD.

Compilation and installation
============================

Configure:
% ./configure

Compile:
% make

Install:
# make install

This will install the library in ocamlfind default installation
directory which may require root privileges depending on ocamlfind
configuration.
