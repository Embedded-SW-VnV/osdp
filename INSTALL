Requirements
============

Compilation of the OSDP libraries requires:

* OCaml (>= 4.01)
* ocamlfind
* Zarith (Debian package libzarith-ocaml-dev, Opam package zarith),
* ocplib-simplex (>= 0.3, Opam package ocplib-simplex)

and optionally:

* Camlp4 (Debian package camlp4)
* CSDP (Debian package coinor-csdp)
* MOSEK (no Debian package)
* SDPA{,-GMP,-DD} (Debian package sdpa for SDPA, no Debian Package for others)

Please note however that the OSDP library is mostly an interface to
SDP solvers and is quite useless if none of them (CSDP, MOSEK or SDPA)
is installed.

CSDP
----

You just need the csdp binary in your PATH. This can for instance be
done by installing the coinor-csdp package on Debian based systems.

MOSEK
-----

If you use MOSEK: Don't forget to set both PATH *and* LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to the directory containing the mosek binaries and libraries.

SDPA{,-GMP,-DD}
---------------

For SDPA{,-GMP,-DD}, you just need the binary in your PATH. For SDPA,
this can for instance be done by installing the sdpa package on Debian
based systems.

SDPA-DD
-------

If you use SDPA-DD: install the QD library from
http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist before compiling SDPA-DD.

Compilation and installation
============================

Configure:
% ./configure

Compile:
% make

Install:
# make install

This will install the library in ocamlfind default installation
directory which may require root privileges depending on ocamlfind
configuration.
